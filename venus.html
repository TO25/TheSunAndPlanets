                Venus has the distinction of being the only planet in our solar system to be named after a
				goddess instead of a god. Telescopes weren’t as advanced as they are now in Roman times. 
				Meaning, not every planet could be seen - only a few are visible to the human eye. Out of 
				all the planets that can be seen by the human eye Venus shone the brightest. It was named 
				Venus due to its shining beauty being like the beauty of Venus herself. So Venus was named 
				after the Roman goddess of love, and its symbol is the symbol for "female". Almost all of 
				its canyons and craters are named after famous women, such as Sacagawea.
              </p>

                Venus is the second closest planet to the Sun, the closest to Earth, and the sixth biggest
				planet in the Solar System. There are five planets visible to the naked eye. But Venus is by
				far the easiest to see. Its thick clouds reflect lots of sunlight into space, making Venus the
				second brightest object in our night sky (the brightest object is the Moon). Venus is the third  
                brightest object in Earth’s sky, after the Sun and the Moon.
                Venus was likely first observed by the Mayans around 650 CE, helping them to create a very accurate
				calendar. It’s most visible at sunrise and sunset. Like Mercury was thought of as two different 
				planets by the Ancient Egyptians - Morning star and Evening star.
             </p>

               Venus is often described as the Earth’s "twin" or "sister planet". It is almost the same size as our
			   planet and has a similar internal structure. But the two worlds are very different. Of all the planets,
			   Venus has the most circular orbit, with an eccentricity of 0.68 percent. When Venus happens to lie 
			   between the Sun and the Earth it comes closer to the Earth than any other planet. Because Venus’s orbit
			   around the Sun passes inside the Earth’s orbit, it also goes through phases that go from new to full and 
			   back to new again. These phases are the different variations of light emanating from it as seen from the 
			   Earth, much like the Moon’s phases. When Venus is new it is directly between the Earth and the Sun.
               At full, it is on the opposite side of the Earth from the Sun.
             </p>
             <p>
               During a transit, Venus looks like a tiny black disc passing across the Sun’s surface. A <i>transit</i>
			   is somewhat like a solar eclipse, occurring when the planet is between the Earth and the Sun. The transits
			   have always provided astronomers with lots of information about not only Venus, but our Solar System. The
			   first observation of a transit of Venus occurred in 1639 and helped gauge the size of the Solar System itself.
			   The one in 2012 is hoped to help us find planets outside our Solar System, or exoplanets. Venus spins more 
			   slowly than any other planet. It also spins in the opposite direction (clockwise) to every planet apart from
			   Uranus. The Sun rises in the west and sets in the east on Venus.
             </p>
             <p>
               There is a theory that Venus formed from the collision of two smaller planets, which impacted at such high
			   speeds that they simply fused together, leaving little debris. Another is that the planet experienced other
			   multiple impact events - and even had one or more moons - that caused its spin to reverse. Venus’s internal
			   make-up does not include a dynamo, like Earth’s. A <i>dynamo</i> is a convecting, rotating fluid that conducts 
			   electricity and is responsible for a planet’s magnetic field. Venus may have a liquid outer core and that conducts
               electricity, but does not convect and rotates too slowly to produce dynamo.
             </p>
             <p>
               Venus has densest atmosphere in the Solar System, with a mass about 90 times that of Earth’s atmosphere. 
			   There’s a heavy, sulphuric layer of clouds that scatter about 90 percent of the sunlight, which prevents 
			   viewing of the planet’s surface and keeps it dim. Below the cloud layer is a layer of carbon dioxide, mixed
			   with a bit of nitrogen. <i>Magellan’s</i> map of Venus is so detailed that we know more about Venus’s surface
               than we do about parts of Earth’s ocean floor! Magellan’s maps show no signs of water (past or present) and
			   no moving crustal plates or active volcanoes today. Venus is smooth, with a young surface - but it is also 
			   covered in volcanoes and lava flows that may have lasted for millions of years. Venus is smooth because the
			   atmosphere burns up smaller meteors before they can reach the surface.
             </p>
             <p>
               It’s hotter than Mercury, thanks to runaway global warming caused by its carbon dioxide atmosphere. Its oceans
			   boiled away long ago. Venus is hot because of a process called greenhouse effect. The Sun’s heat passes through 
			   the atmosphere and warms the ground, which than reemits warmth. The reemitted warmth is trapped by the atmosphere,
			   much as glass traps heat in a greenhouse.
