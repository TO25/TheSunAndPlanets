            Earth is the only planet that does not get its name from Greek or Roman mythology. Earth 
			wasn’t named after a god because only planets got to be named after gods, and early astronomers
			didn’t really see Earth as a planet. To them Earth was just home, the planets where the far off
			specks in the night sky. By the time we realised earth was just another planet the name "Earth" 
			has been cemented, coming from the German words for ground erda or erde. Earth is also known as
			is Terra Firma. This name comes from Latin meaning Firm Land, and in the Roman mythology 
            Terra/Tellus was the goddess of the Earth.  
          </p>

            Earth is the third planet from Sun, fifth largest planet in the Solar System and the densest
			planet overall. It is the only place in the solar system where life has been found.  It’s the
			only planet that has all of the elements needed to support life. Life’s been here for at least
			3.9 billion years.
          </p>
          <p>
            Earth has an eccentric, elliptical orbit. The axial tilt of 23.4 degrees means that the northern
			and southern hemispheres are exposed to the Sun at different times, resulting in our seasons. 
			The Moon has a rotational period that’s the same length as it takes to orbit our planet. This means
			that the same side is always facing us. Tidal interaction means that the Moon is moving away from us
			at a rate of about 38 millimeters per year. The tides aren’t just caused by the gravitational pull 
			of the Moon. It’s a complex relationship between the Moon, the Sun’s gravity, and Earth’s rotation.
			Not only do the tides cause sea levels to rise and fall, but they may also be what’s keeping the Earth’s
            tilt stable. The Moon formed not long after the Earth. A large object about the size of Mars collided 
			with the Earth. Some of the object’s mass merged with the Earth, some shot out into space and some formed
			into the Moon.
          </p>

            Asteroids, comets and other objects passing by deposited water and ice, ultimately leading to the 
			formation of the oceans. The Sun was still forming at this time and as its activity increased, so did
			the Earth’s temperature. Volcanic activity and outgassing are responsible for the Earth’s initial atmosphere.
			This multilayered atmosphere includes 78 percent nitrogen, 21 percent oxygen, and 1 percent trace amounts 
			of argon, carbon dioxide, and water vapor.
          </p>
          <p>
            Earth formed from the <i>solar nebula</i> – a cloud of dust and gas left over from the Sun’s formation 
			about 4.54 billion years ago. It may have taken between 10 and 20 million years for the Earth to fully 
			form. It initially started out as a molten planet, but a buildup of a  water in the atmosphere cooled 
			the outer layers, eventually forming a solid crust. Every 500 million years or so, erosion and movements 
			of the plates that make up the Earth’s crust erase and recycle most of the Earth’s surface. There are 
			numerous minerals in the Earth but just eight of them make up about 99 percent of the entire Earth: 
			iron, oxygen, silicon, magnesium, sulphur, nickel, calcium and aluminium.
          </p>
          <p>
            From the inside out, the Earth comprises a core, mantle, crust and atmosphere. The blue color of Earth’s
			sky is created by water droplets in the air. Earth’s rapid spin and molten nickel-iron core create a 
			magnetic field around the planet. Earth has both inner and outer core. The inner core is solid, while 
			the outer core is liquid. The Earth’s core is hotter than that of the surface of the Sun. The major source 
			of the heat is a radioactive decay, while about 20 percent comes from energy generated by the gravitational
			binding of the planet. Enclosing the core is the mantle, which is divided into two layers. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The layer of ozone blocks ultraviolet radiation from the Sun, protecting life below. Ozone is also part
			of the greenhouse effect, which helps sustain life on Earth. Gases trap heat rising from the surface, which 
			keeps the average temperature at 15 degrees Celsius.
          </p>
          <p>
            Earth’s surface consists of vast oceans (71 percent), continents of land, and two polar ice caps-all supported
			by a thin, rocky crust. The crust is broken into seven huge segments and many smaller ones. Called tectonic plates,
			these giant slabs of rock creep slowly over earth’s surface, pushed by churning movements in the softer, hot rock
			that fills most if Earth’s interior. As tectonic plates move they bump into each other and grind past one another,
			generating immense forces that thrust up mountain ranges, unleash volcanic eruptions, and trigger earthquakes.
			These powerful forces continually change earth’s appearance, as do the actions of wind and water.
