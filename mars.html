              One of Mars’s most popular attributes is it’s red colour. This red colouring reminded 
			  the Romans of blood spilt in war. Due to this Mars was named after the Roman god of war,
			  and it shares the symbol for male. Mars, the god of war, was a hugely important god in Roman
			  culture, and it tells you a lot about what the Romans prioritized. Yet Mars was a hugely 
			  important god to the Romans for other reason. Most noticeably, it was thought that Mars was 
			  the father of Romulus, Rome’s legendary founder. What’s also of interest is that the moons 
			  of Mars are called Phobos and Deimos. These were the names of Ares (Mars’s Greek equivalent) 
			  children. So Mars and its moons are representing a father and his children.

              Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second smallest planet in the Solar System. 
			  Mars formed about 4.6 billion years ago, along with the other planets in the Solar System.
			  Mars is one of the brightest objects in the night sky. Martian soil is sandy and red from 
			  iron oxide, or rust. The red dust in the air makes the sky pink. It’s sometimes called the
              red planet because of its rusty coloring.  
            </p>
            <p>
              Mars is half the size of Earth. We can easily see Mars from Earth without a telescope, and
			  it’s actually easier to see when it’s further away from the Earth in its orbit because our 
			  atmosphere gets in the way. When the Earth is exactly between the planet Mars and the Sun and
			  the three objects are in a straight line, it’s known as <i>opposition</i>. Because there are no
			  oceans on Mars, it has the same amount of dry land as the Earth does. Mars is so much like the
			  Earth, but also so very different. It is a terrestrial planet and has almost identical geographical
			  features and a similar axial tilt. Mars has four seasons - they’re just longer and of varied lengths.
			  Spring, summer, autumn, and winter last twice as long as these seasons do on Earth. Summer’s warming 
			  often brings planet-wide dust storms, while winter creates carbon-dioxide frost.
            </p>
            <p>
              Mars is a cold desert - even daytime temperatures remain below freezing.  Mars’s thin atmosphere is
			  mostly made up of the stuff we exhale - carbon dioxide. Mars has a differentiated internal structure,
			  with an outer crust, a mantle and a core. Mars’s core is mostly made up of iron, with nickel and traces 
			  of other elements, such as sulphur. There is no magnetic field generated at the core, but Mars may have 
			  had a magnetic field in the past. There are currently areas of magnetization at a different places on the
              planet’s surface. Atop the core lies Mars’s silicate mantle, which is between 1,300 and 1,800 km thick.
			  Volcanic activity on the planet’s surface originated here. The crust is more than twice as thick as the 
			  Earth’s crust. It contains oxygen, silicon, iron, calcium and other metals.
            </p>
            <p>
              Mars has a very eccentric elliptical orbit. Its eccentricity is 0.09, which is the second most eccentric
			  in the Solar System behind Mercury. Mars once had a much rounder orbit. It has changed due to gravitational
			  influences from the Sun and other planets. Mars’s moons Phobos and Deimos are kind of potato-shaped and 
			  probably used to be asteroids until they were caught by Mars’s gravity.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are also volcanoes and polar ice caps on Mars. Olympus Mons, a huge inactive volcano that is three
			  times the size of Mt. Everest, is likely the biggest volcano in the solar system. A vast canyon called 
			  Valles Marineris stretches a quarter of the way around this frozen desert world. It formed long ago when
			  the crust of the young planet split open.  There’s no liquid water on Mars now. Dry river beds show that 
			  water flowed here long ago.
