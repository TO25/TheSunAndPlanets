              Mercury (Hermes) is the god of messages and communication. Many see him as the messenger of the
			  gods. Delivering so many messages for gods mean you have to be quick, and it’s thought that Mercury
			  was the quickest of all the gods. The god Mercury and the planet Mercury both share speed. Whether that be 
			  speed in sending messages, or speed in circulating the Sun. Being the closest to the Sun means
			  that it’s the planet that revolves around the Sun the quickest in our solar system. It’s because
			  of this swiftness around the Sun that Mercury has its name.
            </p>

            <p>
              Mercury is the smallest of the Solar System’s planets and lies closest to the Sun. We have known
			  about its existence since the third millennium BCE, when Sumerians wrote about it. But they thought
			  that it was two separate planets - a morning star and an evening star - because that’s  just about
			  the only time you can see it due to its closeness to the Sun. The Greeks knew it was just one planet,
			  and even that it orbited the Sun. Mercury is incredibly dense; almost on par with Earth’s density due
			  to its heavy iron content. The Earth’s density is due to gravitational compression, but Mercury has a 
              weak gravitational field in comparison to the Earth’s. That’s why scientists have decided that its 
			  density must be due to its large, iron-reach core. Mercury may be the closest planet to the Sun, but 
			  it’s not the hottest. Venus gets hotter, thanks to its carbon dioxide atmosphere.
            </p>
            <p>
              Mercury is tilted on its axis just like Earth, but its axial tilt is only 2.11 degrees away from the
			  plane of the ecliptic. Contrast that with the Earth’s tilt at 23.4 degrees. While that causes the Earth’s
			  seasons, Mercury has no seasons at all. The side that faces the Sun is incredibly hot, and the side away 
			  from the Sun is incredibly cold. In the daytime, the surface is hot enough to melt lead, but at night it’s 
			  cold enough to liquefy air. There is no atmosphere to retain any heat.
            </p>
            <p>
              Mercury rotates one and a half times for every trip around the Sun, with a 3:2 spin-orbit resonance (three
			  rotations for every two revolutions). When Mercury is at its <i>perihelion</i> (closest to the Sun), its 
			  revolution is faster than its rotation. If you were standing on the planet’s surface, the Sun would appear 
			  to be moving west in the sky, but then stop and start moving slowly eastward for a few days. Then as Mercury
			  starts moving away from the Sun in its rotation (known as <i>aphelion</i>), its revolution slows down and 
              the Sun starts moving westward in the sky again. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Mercury has the most eccentric orbit of any planet. Its eccentricity is 0.21 degrees, resulting in a very
			  ovoid orbit. This is part of the reason for its extreme temperature fluctuations as well as the Sun’s unusual
			  behavior in its sky.
            </p>
            <p>
              Mercury contains about 30 percent silicate materials and 70 percent metals. Some believe that Mercury’s
			  huge core is due to what was going on with the Sun while Mercury was forming. If Mercury formed before the
			  energy output from the Sun stabilized, it may have had twice the mass that it does now. Then when the Sun 
			  contracted and stabilized, massive temperature fluctuations vaporized some of the planet’s crust and mantle
			  rock. Or a thinner mantle and crust may have always existed due to drag on the <i>solar nebula</i> (the Sun’s 
              cloud of dust and gas from which the planet’s formed) from the close proximity to the Sun itself. The Messenger 
			  spacecraft has found high levels of materials like potassium on the surface, which would have been vaporized at 
			  the extremely high temperatures needed for the former theory. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Not long after it formed, the planet was hit heavily and often in at least two waves by large asteroids and 
			  comets, which caused its extremely cratered surface. The craters range from small, bowl-shaped ones to the huge
			  Caloris Basin, which is nearly one-third the width of the planet. Couple this with periods of strong volcanic 
			  activity, which resulted in the smooth plains, and you have a very hilly surface. Because of its small size and
			  wide changes in temperature, the planet Mercury doesn’t have a true atmosphere. 
            </p>
            <p>
              <i>Mariner 10</i> could photograph only half of Mercury during its three flybys, so there’s a lot about the
			  planet that we still don’t know. It’s a hard place to get to because of the strong gravity and powerful heat
			  of the super close Sun. And it’s a hard planet to observe with a telescope. There’s too much sun glare. Even 
			  the Hubble doesn’t dare look Mercury’s way. The intense solar radiation might fry its electronics. It might be 
			  hard to imagine, but radar telescopes on Earth have spotted ice on Mercury. It seems that ice survives deep inside 
              steep-walled craters near Mercury’s poles. Scientists think that the ice is in the permanent shadow of the crater 
			  walls, so sunlight never reaches it. The presence of ice on a world where the Sun is eleven times brighter than 
			  it is on Earth is astonishing.
