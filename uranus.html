          Uranus was named for the Roman god who was the father of the Titans. The name was suggested
		  by German astronomer Johann Bode. In the way Saturn was Jupiter’s father, Uranus was Saturn’s
		  father. So the three planets are son, father, and grandfather. Uranus’s many moons are named 
		  after characters in plays by William Shakespeare and poems of Alexander Pope. British astronomer 
		  William Herschel, who discovered the planet named it after himself. Herschel also offered to name 
		  the planet after then King of England George III, wanting to name it the Georgium Sidus. 
          Hypercronius was suggested, meaning "above cronus" with cronus being the Greek name for Saturn, 
		  this name related to the planets position by Saturn. Minerva was also suggested, the name of the
		  Roman goddess of wisdom.

          Uranus is the third largest planet in the solar system. It is the seventh planet from the Sun.
		  Uranus was unknown to ancient astronomers, even though it is just visible with the naked eye in 
		  perfectly clear and dark skies. It’s so dim and has such a slow orbit compared to the other known
		  planets that it didn’t register as one. It just looks like a faint pinpoint of greenish or bluish light.
		  It was the first planet that was discovered through the use of a telescope. It was discovered by musician
		  William Herschel from his back garden in Bath, England, in 1781. When he  first saw Uranus, he thought it was a comet. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Uranus is 14 times more massive than Earth. The planet is similar to Neptune but has a paler blue,
		  almost featureless face. It is the coldest of all the planets and generates very little heat from 
		  within. The planet contains less hydrogen and helium than Jupiter and Saturn but has more rock and water. 
		  Uranus is the third largest planet by radius and the fourth largest by mass. It is about 3 billion kilometers
		  from the Sun, which means that it receives 0.0025 percent of the sunlight that the Earth gets. 
        </p>
        <p>
          It orbits on its side perhaps because it was knocked over by a collision with another planet early
		  in its history. This means that its poles get more sunlight than does its equator. While other planets 
		  have extreme tilts, none are so perfectly perpendicular to the plane of its orbit. The tilt has impacted 
		  just about everything about Uranus. Its extreme tilt gives it very long seasons. Each season on Uranus 
		  lasts more than 20 Earth years. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Uranus is a cold, windy world made of gases and liquid. There is no land. It has a core of silicate 
		  rock, encased in ices and topped with a gaseous layer. The core must be very small, since Uranus is 
		  the second least dense planet. The ice mantle surrounding the core is fluid, with volatiles like methane, 
		  ammonia and water. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The atmosphere contains three layers: the thermosphere, the stratosphere and the troposphere. The
		  troposphere has four cloud layers: methane, hydrogen sulphide and ammonia, ammonium hydrosulphide, 
		  and water clouds at the upper limit. The stratosphere sits between the troposphere and the outermost 
		  layer, the thermosphere. Uranus’s pale blue color is due to the methane in its atmosphere. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Deeper inside the planet, it gets very hot. A deep, superheated layer of water, ammonia, and methane
		  boils and bubbles up gases that form into clouds. Until Voyager 2 explored Uranus’s atmosphere, we didn’t know 
		  much about its features. The probe found a bright polar cap at the south pole, as well as a lighter band called
		  a collar. There are many more clouds in the northern hemisphere, which are brighter and at a higher elevation than 
		  the ones in the southern hemisphere. The southern collar had nearly disappeared, while one in the north had grown. 
		  Uranus has a faint set of rings, which were discovered in 1977. Its thin and dark rings might be broken-up moons. 
		  The larger moons of Uranus are like small terrestrial planets of ice and rock. The odd moon Miranda has high 
		  cliffs and winding valleys.
