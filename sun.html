          The Sun’s star name is Sol, after the Roman god of the sun. Sol is the Roman equivalent of the Greek sun god Helios.

          There are millions of other stars like the Sun in the Milky Way galaxy, and there are billions of 
		  other galaxies in the universe. Almost the entire mass of the solar system -  99.86 percent - is that
		  of the Sun. All the other objects in our solar system combined make up the other .14 percent. The force
		  of gravity generated by this enormous mass keeps the planets trapped in orbit around it. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The sun was formed from a massive gravitational collapse when space dust and gas from a nebula collided,
		  and became an orb 100 times as big and over 300,000 times as heavy as Earth. The sun is a nearly perfect
		  sphere of hot, glowing gas. Its source of power lies buried deep in the central core, where a nuclear furnace
		  rages nonstop, turning matter into pure heat and light. Scientist divide the sun’s interior into three distinct
		  layers: the core, the radiative zone, and the convective zone. All three are made solely of gas, but the gas gets
		  hotter and denser toward the center.
        </p>
		<p>
		   Inside the hot, dense core, the process of nuclear fusion releases energy. Every second, 683 million tons of 
		   hydrogen are fused into helium in the core. Electromagnetic radiation travels out from the Sun’s core to its surface,
		   escaping into space as electromagnetic radiation, a blinding light, and incredible levels of solar heat. In fact, the
		   core of the sun is actually hotter than the surface, but when heat escapes from the surface, the temperature rises to
		   over 1-2 million degrees.
		</p>
		<p>
		  Outside the core is the radiative zone, which is not dense enough for nuclear fusion to take place. Energy from the
		  core seeps very slowly out through this layer. In the convective zone, vast bubbles of hot gas rise to the surface,
		  cool, and then fall, transferring energy from the Sun’s heart to the exterior. The Sun’s apparent surface is called 
		  the photosphere. Energy escapes into space from here as light. A solar flare is a rapid release of energy in the solar
		  atmosphere. It can cause geomagnetic storms on the Sun, including shock waves and plasma expulsions.
        </p>
		<p>
		  Like all objects in space, the Sun rotates. It is a ball of gas and turns at different places. The sun is the center
		  of our solar system and it makes life on Earth possible by powering photosynthesis. A solar eclipse happens when the Moon
		  gets between the Sun and the Earth, blocking our view of the Sun.
