           Jupiter is the biggest of all the planets in our solar system. Because of its huge size, Jupiter
		   was named after the Roman king of the gods. The Romans regarded Jupiter as the equivalent of the 
		   Greek Zeus. Zeus is perhaps known best not for his incredible power and feats of heroism, but more 
		   for his libido. Though a married man, Zeus couldn’t resist so many other people - man or woman. His lovers 
		   are so renown that four of Jupiter’s moons are named after four of his lovers: Europa, Ganymede, Callisto, 
		   and Io. None of Jupiter’s moons, however, are named after his wife Juno. This makes the planet of Jupiter 
		   and it’s moons a floating reminder of infidelity.

           Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It’s 2.5 times more
		   massive than all the other planets put together. Jupiter has a very striking and unusual appearance, 
		   with moving bands of red, orange, white and brown. The planet is the fourth brightest object in our night sky.
         </p>
         <p>
           The planet Jupiter itself isn’t like Earth, Mars, Venus, or Mercury. It’s not a terrestrial planet made of 
		   solid rock and covered in land. Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune are gas giants. They’re enormous spinning 
		   balls of gas and liquid under intense pressure. Its strong gravitational pull greatly affects the orbits of other
		   bodies in the Solar System. The solar system’s biggest planet had a thin ring a little less than 19 miles (30 km) thick! 
         </p>
         <p>
           Jupiter was larger when it was first formed - it’s been shrinking about two centimeters (0.8 inches) per
		   year due to its heating and cooling process. Although Jupiter is large in diameter and mass, it’s not very 
		   dense thanks to its gaseousness. Since Jupiter is a gaseous planet, it’s mostly about atmosphere. The gases
		   just get denser, hotter and under greater pressures as you go further towards the center. Jupiter is about 90
		   percent hydrogen and ten per cent helium - volume - wise. But if you measure the composition of the planet 
           by mass, there is 75 percent hydrogen and 24 percent helium. There are also traces of ammonia, methane, 
		   carbon, hydrogen sulphide and other elements and compounds.
         </p>
         <p>
           The colours visible in photos of Jupiter are a result of the different layers of clouds in the atmosphere
		   which move and flow in complex patterns. They are called bands, and there are two different kinds: 
		   lighter-coloured areas, known as zones, and dark-coloured ones called belts. Zones are dense ammonia ice 
		   clouds in higher areas, while the dark belts contain thinner, lower, warmer clouds. Their red/orange colours 
		   come from sulphur and phosphorous, while carbon creates some of the lighter grey colours.
         </p>
         <p>
           Jupiter has a very small axial tilt of just 3.13 degrees, so there are no seasons on the planet. But
		   it does have weather patterns. The evaporation and condensation process of water create dense clouds. 
		   There are strong storms, including powerful lightning strikes, mainly in the belts. Storms on Jupiter tend 
		   to be very short, but a few major storms have been raging for a long time. The biggest and most well-known 
		   of these is the Great Red Spot, which has been around for 180 to 300 years. The GRS is Jupiter’s most visible
		   feature and is a strong, anticyclonic storm and could fit two to three Earth’s inside it.
         </p>
         <p>
           In some ways Jupiter is less like a planet and more like a star with its own mini–solar system. Sometimes it’s
		   even been referred to as a ‘failed star’ because it’s made of the same gases as the Sun. If Jupiter had been 
		   between 50 and 100 times more massive, it would have become a star.
         </p>
         <p>
           Jupiter has dozens of orbiting moons, some of which are larger than Pluto or even Mercury. Each of those
		   moons is very different, as unique as the planets that circle our sun. The moon called Io is only half the 
		   size of Earth’s moon. But it is nothing like any moon ever seen before. Io is yellow, orange, and brown, and
		   it is covered with active volcanoes spewing stuff into space. It was the first time any active volcanoes had 
		   ever been seen except on Earth. (Mars’s ancient volcanoes are long dead). The Voyagers also found evidence of a
		   liquid ocean beneath the frozen crust of Jupiter’s moon Europa, and plate tectonics on the surface of Ganymede. 
		   Ganymede is the solar system’s largest moon. Most of Jupiter’s other moons are probably asteroids captured by 
		   the planet’s gravity.
