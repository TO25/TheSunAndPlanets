               Neptune looks like a floating ocean in the sky, so it was named after the Roman
			   god of the ocean Neptune. Neptune is the brother of Jupiter and was one of his 
			   siblings that he freed from his father’s stomach. When Jupiter freed Neptune and 
			   his siblings from his father’s stomach, they divided up the universe amongst themselves.
			   Taking rule of the universe from their father. Jupiter took the sky and Neptune took the 
			   sea. Neptune’s moons are named after Greek and Roman water deities, since the planet is 
			   named after the god of the sea.

               Neptune is a cold, distant world and the farthest Planet. It’s the smallest of the four gas
			   giants, but it would still hold the volume of nearly 60 Earths. As the eighth planet from the 
			   Sun, Neptune was the farthest known planet until Pluto was discovered in Neptune’s orbit. It’s
			   one of the four gas giants, and is also called Uranus’s "twin". Neptune is slightly smaller than 
			   Uranus and looks bluer because its atmosphere contains more methane.  Because they are similar in 
			   composition, both planets are often known as ice giants to distinguish them from Jupiter and Saturn.  
             </p>
             <p>
               The planet was discovered in 1846. It was the first planet located through the use of a mathematical 
               prediction instead of by observation of the night sky. French astronomer Alexis Bouvard closely observed 
               the orbit of Uranus, and detected a gravitational perturbation that he deduced could only be explained by
               another planet. From his observations, other astronomers calculated the location of Neptune. John Couch Adams
               in England and Urbain Le Verrier in France calculated where in the sky the undiscovered planet must be. Within
               days, Neptune was spotted from an observatory in Germany.
             </p>

               Neptune’s magnetosphere is strongly tilted away from its rotational axis, at 47 degrees.  Neptune’s
			   tilt is much like Earth’s at 28.32 degrees, so it has regular seasons, which happen to last about 40
			   years, because at 2.8 billion miles from the Sun, it has an orbit of 164.79 years. There’s no land on 
			   Neptune, but winds whip through the blue methane clouds at more than 1,200 miles (2,000 km) per hour.
			   This violent weather is thought to be powered by heat from inside Neptune since the planet is too far
			   from the Sun to absorb much of its warmth.  
             </p>
             <p>
               Neptune’s core contains silicate rock, iron, nickel and it is under great pressure. The mantle surrounding 
			   the core is made of methane, ammonia and water.  It’s atmosphere surrounding the mantle is about 80 percent 
			   hydrogen, 19 percent helium, and the rest traces of ammonia, water and methane. The methane which absorbs red
			   light in the spectrum, gives Neptune its colour.  
             </p>
             <p>
               Neptune also has a barely visible system of rings and more than a dozen known moons. Its largest moon, Triton,
			   is even colder than Pluto, and has great geysers that spew out nitrogen gas. Triton orbits Neptune in the opposite
			   direction of the planet’s spin, and the moon is slowly getting closer. Eventually (in 10 to 100 million years) it 
			   will collide with the planet and break up into a ring system that is bigger than Saturn’s. With surface temperatures
			   that reach down to -391°F (-235°C), Triton is the coldest body in our solar system yet visited. Neptune’s Great 
			   Dark Spot is a huge storm that is the size of Earth.
