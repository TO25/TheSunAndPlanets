          Saturn was named for the Roman god of agriculture and time. To the Romans, Saturn was the furthest
		  planet they knew of, meaning to them it was the planet that would take the longest time to orbit the
		  Sun. It could’ve been because of this length of time it took to orbit and Saturn being the god of time
		  as to why the planet was named after him. Also of interest is that Saturn is next to Jupiter. In mythology 
          Saturn was Jupiter’s father. You would think that the “father” planet would be the bigger of the two, but
		  Jupiter is far bigger than Saturn. Perhaps this reflect how in mythology Jupiter had to slay his tyrant 
		  father Saturn who kept eating all his children in fear that they would overthrow him. Jupiter (or Zeus as 
		  it would’ve been originally in Greek) was born unbeknownst to his father Saturn (Cronus in Greek) allowing
          him to kill his father and free his eaten siblings from his father’s belly.

          Saturn is the second largest planet in the Solar System behind Jupiter and the sixth planet from the Sun.
		  Like other gas giant planets, Saturn has no solid land. It’s a swirling ball of gas and high-pressure liquid.
		  It’s the farthest planet you can see without a telescope. From Earth, Saturn looks like a bright yellowish point.
		  The word Saturday comes from the word Saturn.
        </p>
        <p>
          Saturn is more than 95 times more massive than the Earth, although it has just one-eighth the density. Saturn 
		  is the least dense of all the planets. With the density of just 0.687 grams per cubic centimeter, it is less 
		  dense than water, meaning that it would float in an ocean if there were one big enough to hold it.
        </p>

          Saturn has become known as the “jewel” of the Solar System for its appearance. When Galileo Galilei spotted
		  Saturn’s rings in 1610, he didn’t know what planetary rings were. He believed he was seeing a triple planet 
		  - a big Saturn with two smaller planets on either side of it. The planet has nine rings and three arcs, with
		  two different divisions. They might have originated with some of the nebulous material left from Saturn’s formation,
		  or the rings could have come from a moon that got too close to the planet and disintegrated.  Saturn has the most
		  complex system of rings in the solar system. The rings extend many thousands of miles away from the planet and 
		  are less than one kilometer thick. Saturn’s ring system is made up of billions of bits of ice, dust and rock. 
		  Some ring particles are as small as a grain of sugar, while others are as big as a house. The entire planet and
		  all its rings would just fit between the Earth and the Moon.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most of the Saturn’s moons are tiny, but some of them are unique in the Solar System. Titan, for example,
		  is the biggest, comprising approximately 90 percent of the mass around the planet and is larger than Mercury. 
		  It’s also the only moon to sport an atmosphere. Titan also has liquids on its surface, a feature so far found
		  only on Earth. Saturn’s moon Rhea might even have rings of its own. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Aside from rings, one of the most interesting features of Saturn is its <i>auroras</i>. These beautiful light displays
		  have been captured at both the north and south pole regions and appear as circles of light around each pole. 
		  The south pole is much warmer than the rest of the planet; it’s believed to be the warmest spot on Saturn.
        </p>

          Saturn is a gas giant as it has no solid surface and is mainly composed of gas. But it does have a rocky core,
		  which is similar to composition to the Earth’s. Comprising iron, nickel and silicate rock, it is estimated to 
		  be between 10 and 20 times the size of the Earth’s core. Surrounding the core, there is a layer of ice made of
		  ammonia and other elements, then a layer of highly pressurized metallic hydrogen, and finally molecular hydrogen
		  that changes from liquid to a gas. Thin clouds of water and ammonia stream above cold hydrogen and helium, giving 
		  Saturn its yellow and gold bands of color. The outer layers of the planet are different types of ice, including 
		  ammonia, ammonium hydrosulphide and water. Density, pressure and temperature all increase as you pass through the
		  atmosphere and into the core, resulting in a very hot interior at about 11.700°C. Saturn sends out more than twice 
		  the energy it receives from the Sun.
        </p>
        <p>
          Like Jupiter, Saturn has wind jets that alternate westwards and eastwards out from the equator. But Saturnian
		  winds are fast, reaching maximum speeds of around 1,800 km/h, they are the second fastest winds among the Solar
		  System’s planets after Neptune.
